# PDB 7k5i

## Overview

**Protein name**: leader protein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: Cryo-EM

## Description

This electron microscopy structure shows the SARS-CoV-2 leader protein (Nsp1) in a complex with the human ribosomal 40S subunit and rRNA but with worse percentile ranks than 6zol. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain into the mRNA channel of the ribosome, where it interferes with mRNA binding and inhibits cellular (not viral) translation. Nsp1 effectively blocks retinoic acid-inducible gene I-dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection.
