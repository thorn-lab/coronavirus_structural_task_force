# PDB 7k43

## Overview

**Protein name**: surface glycoprotein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: Cryo-EM

## Description

EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in complex with the S2M11 neutralizing antibody Fab fragment. Non polymer only nonamer, spike with three chains and antibody with a heavy and a light chain with three chains each. S2M11 competitively blocks ACE2 attachment and it locks the spike in a closed conformation.
