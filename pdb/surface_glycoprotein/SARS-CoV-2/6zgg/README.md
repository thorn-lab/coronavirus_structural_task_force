# PDB 6zgg

## Overview

**Protein name**: surface glycoprotein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: Cryo-EM

## Description

A cleaved spike glycoprotein precursor by furin-like cellular proteases for SARS-CoV-2. It is a homo trimer molecule with 3 chains. The structure is reported with one receptor binding domain erected. Two other relevant structures are 6zgi and 6zgh which are also furin cleaved spike proteins. 6zgi is in a closed conformation and 6zgh is in an intermediate conformation.
