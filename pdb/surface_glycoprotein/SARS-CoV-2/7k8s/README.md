# PDB 7k8s

## Overview

**Protein name**: surface glycoprotein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: Cryo-EM

## Description

EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S 2P trimer in complex with the human neutralizing antibody Fab fragment C002 (state 1). Non polymer only nonamer, spike protein with three chains and antibody with a heavy and a light chain with three chains each. Antibody has a similar S binding orientation as the antibody C144 which shows an unusual binding characteristic.
