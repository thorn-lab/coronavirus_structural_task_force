# Base folder 5rfh

## Files downloaded from wwPDB:

5rfh.pdb and 5rfh.cif - contain the coordinates of the threedimensional molecular model, and can be viewed with, for example, Coot or Pymol.

5rfh-sf.cif - contains deposited diffraction data for this PDB entry, if the structure has been solved with X-ray or neutron crystallography.

5rfh.mtz - contains structure factors after automatic refinement of molecular model against the diffraction data.

## Raw diffraction data
