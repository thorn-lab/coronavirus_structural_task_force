- C-terminal helix of chain A out by 9 residues (same as all other existing models of this complex)
- magnesium ions not stable as placed. Removed.
- Adenosine base modelled backwards at residue 18 of chain T
- Pro A505 should be cis
- Pro B183 should be cis (and preceding Trp sidechain was unmodelled despite extremely clear density)
- numerous well-resolved waters added
