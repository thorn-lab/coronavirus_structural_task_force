## Useful Information
"1xjr", "The 3' Untranslated region pseudoknot from SARS-CoV-2 is a highly conserved RNA structural motif found between ORF1a and ORF1ab responsible for frameshifting protein translation over the stop codon found at the 3' end of ORF1a. This electron microscopy model has 6.9Å resolution."
"6xrz", "The 3' Untranslated region stem-loop II-like motif from SARS-CoV is a highly conserved  RNA structural motif found at the 3' terminus or the RNA. This X-ray crystal structure was resolved to to 2.7Å resolution."
